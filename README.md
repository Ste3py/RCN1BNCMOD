üõë Disclaimer:
I won‚Äôt cover how to open the RCN1 here, because disassembly will void your warranty.
However, I will show you how to install the mod once it‚Äôs open.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Once the controller is open, disconnect the joysticks.

![RCN1JOYSTICK](img/img_5.jpg)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Unscrew these three screws.

![RCN1screw](img/img_1.jpg)

3Ô∏è‚É£ You now have access to the PCB.
(Ignore the modded state of my controller. I‚Äôve already done the mod and don‚Äôt have a second RCN1 to show from scratch. The process is the same.)
Disconnect all connectors and remove the screws.
Remove the batteries first.
Be careful with the flex connector under the cage.

![RCN1MB](img/img_0.jpg)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the motherboard.
Then unscrew these two screws and remove the two transparent parts.

![RCN1COVER](img/img_7.jpg)

At this point, your setup should look similar to mine, except you'll still have the original antenna attached.

![RCN1naked](img/img_14.jpg)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the antenna holder by unscrewing these six screws.

![RCN1nakedalt](img/img_14_alt.jpg)

Now you have this piece out:

![RCN1holder](img/img_10.jpg)

Place it back **without screwing it in**.

**Assembling the BNC Connector**
6Ô∏è‚É£ Install the heated insert into the main part, then mount the BNC connector.

![RCN1BNC1](img/img_8.jpg)

7Ô∏è‚É£ On the internal support, install the heated insert and pass the cables through the holes.
It‚Äôs a bit tedious, but there‚Äôs enough space. Just be gentle to avoid damaging the connectors.

![RCN1BNC1](img/img_9.jpg)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Assemble both parts using two M3*5 screws in these holes.

![RCN1BNC2](img/img_8_alt.jpg)

![RCN1BNC3](img/img_11.jpg)

9Ô∏è‚É£ Slide the BNC assembly into the holder.

![RCN1BNC4](img/img_13.jpg)

üîü Mark the three small holes using the 2.8mm drill bit by hand.

![RCN1BNC5](img/img_13_alt.jpg)

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove everything and drill the holes properly.
Then use a screw to cut threads into the plastic and secure everything into place.

![RCN1BNC6](img/img_14_alt2.jpg)

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Route the cables as shown.
You may need to trim some plastic from the transparent parts to accommodate the thicker cables.

![RCN1BNC7](img/img_15.jpg)

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Reassemble everything.
Note: there‚Äôs no special place for the U.FL connector ‚Äî route it carefully.

‚ö† Don‚Äôt forget to connect the antenna before powering on the controller!
